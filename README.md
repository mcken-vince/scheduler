Project to practice working with React, leveraging more complex hooks and manipulating state. 
- Components were largely built in isolation using Storybook.
- Tests are written using Jest and Cypress.
- Server requests are made with Axios.
- Used CircleCI
- Production branch auto-deployed on Netlify, with server deployed on Heroku

Server is deployed on a free Heroku account, so will need a minute to boot up after request is made.
Give it a few seconds and refresh until data loads.
